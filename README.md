This Project is created by Mervin Chung (32068443) as a Final year project.

This is a PHP project so ensure that you have installed the necessary php folders to be able to run localhost. 
you will need to modify the .ini folder and replace it with the folder below : 
[ini file.zip](https://github.com/Scrap-H/CropTech/files/15169843/ini.file.zip)

the file has included some extensions that will be needed to run locally as well as using Composer to download phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

without the ini composer will not be able to download the necessary tools. 

for convenience XAMPP will also be needed to test out the login and registration function
